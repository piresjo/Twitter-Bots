# Trump Tweet Analysis

### Basic Information

The Trump Tweet Analysis Bot is a simple bot, mainly to help me get used to working with Twitter's API, as well as get used to working with libraries like Spacy (https://spacy.io/) and NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/).

As of right June 2017, the bot goes through Donald Trump's personal Twitter account (@realDonaldTrump). It collects all the tweets he has written in the last 24 hours. Then, it analyzes them to determine its sentimentality, which would indicate whether the tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. Through that, we can see whether the president is in a good mood or not.

### Things To Work On

The analysis is fairly basic. In order to get a more accurate reading of his emotional state, I'll need to refine how I interpret the sentimentality readings from nltk.
